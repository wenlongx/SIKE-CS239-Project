In this folder we'll put our load testing script. Basically, we create a script that
    - starts the kafka cluster
    - creates a producer, consumer instance with the specified Serializer
    - set consumer to start listening
    - start timer
    - producer generates N number of random messages, writes it to a local kafka cluster
    - stop timer
